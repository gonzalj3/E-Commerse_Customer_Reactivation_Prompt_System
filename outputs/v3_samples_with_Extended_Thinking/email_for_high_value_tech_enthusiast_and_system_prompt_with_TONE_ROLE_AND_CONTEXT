Subject: The innovation you've been waiting for (plus your carbon impact update)
Hi there,
I hope your Allbirds are still keeping you comfortable! As someone who clearly appreciates thoughtful innovation and quality craftsmanship, I wanted to share something pretty exciting we've been working on.
You might remember when we first introduced Tree Runners made from eucalyptus fiber – it felt revolutionary, right? Well, our materials science team has been at it again. We just launched our Tree Flyer 2, and the performance improvements are genuinely impressive. We've enhanced the midsole with a new bio-based foam that's 20% more responsive while maintaining our commitment to carbon neutrality. The early feedback from our community has been incredible, especially from customers who, like you, appreciate the intersection of innovation and sustainability.
Speaking of impact – since your last order, you've helped us avoid 12.5 kg of CO2 emissions compared to traditional footwear manufacturing. We've also made some major strides in our supply chain: 100% of our wool is now sourced from regenerative farms, and we've eliminated virgin plastic from all our packaging. These aren't just feel-good updates – they represent real, measurable progress toward the future we're building together.
I noticed you particularly loved the precision and attention to detail in your previous selections. That's exactly why I think you'd be fascinated by our latest collection. We're offering our community members early access to three new colorways that launch publicly next month, including a sophisticated charcoal that's perfect for the season transition.
Would you like to take a look at what we've been innovating? I'd love to get your thoughts on the new materials – your perspective as someone who values both performance and purpose would be really valuable.
