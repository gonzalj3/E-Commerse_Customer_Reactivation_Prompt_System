Subject: The innovation you've been waiting for is here, Ronald
Hi Ronald,
Remember that feeling when you first discovered truly comfortable, sustainable footwear? We've been busy pushing the boundaries of what's possible in sustainable innovation, and I thought you'd want to be among the first to see what we've been working on.
Our new Tree Dasher 2 represents a quantum leap in performance technology—featuring our most advanced midsole engineering yet, with 15% better energy return and enhanced breathability through our latest eucalyptus tree fiber innovation. But here's what I think will really catch your attention: we've integrated smart temperature regulation technology that adapts to your environment, maintaining optimal foot climate whether you're in a boardroom or on a trail.
As someone who appreciates cutting-edge features, you'll love knowing that each pair removes the equivalent of 11.5 plastic bottles from potential ocean waste while delivering performance metrics that rival traditional synthetic athletic shoes. We're also piloting our new carbon-negative packaging process—something we're only rolling out to our most valued customers first.
Because you've been such an important part of the Allbirds community, I'd love to offer you exclusive early access to the Tree Dasher 2, along with our white-glove delivery service and dedicated customer success support. You'll receive your pair a full two weeks before our public launch, plus detailed technical specifications and performance analytics.
Ready to experience the future of sustainable performance? Your early access window is open for the next 72 hours.
