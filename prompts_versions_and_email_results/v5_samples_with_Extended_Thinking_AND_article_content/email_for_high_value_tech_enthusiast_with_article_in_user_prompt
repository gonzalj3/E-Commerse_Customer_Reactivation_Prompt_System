Subject: Your Allbirds are missing you (and we rarely do this...)
Hi there,
I noticed it's been a little while since your last order, and honestly, the timing couldn't be better.
Here's the thing - we almost never put our shoes on sale. But right now, we're offering something special: cult-favorites like Tree Runners and Tree Dashers starting at just $60. Even our newest Tree Gliders are marked down to $94.
As someone who appreciates innovation and performance, you'll love what we've been working on. Our Tree Dasher 2 now features enhanced responsive foam that adapts to your stride, while our eucalyptus fiber technology has gotten even more breathable and moisture-wicking.
The sustainability story keeps getting better too. Every pair purchased helps us stay carbon neutral while proving that premium performance and environmental responsibility aren't mutually exclusive.
Since you value cutting-edge materials and premium quality, I thought you'd want to know about this rare opportunity before it's gone.
Shop the Sale
Best,
Emma
Customer Experience Team, Allbirds
P.S. These sales don't happen often, and with our community of conscious consumers growing, the best styles tend to go quickly.
