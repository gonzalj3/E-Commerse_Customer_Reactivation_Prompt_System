Subject: The performance upgrade you've been waiting for (+ exclusive summer access)
Hi [Customer Name],
I've been thinking about your last Allbirds purchase and wondering how those [previous product] have been performing for you. As someone who appreciates cutting-edge innovation, I wanted to personally reach out about some exciting developments in our performance technology that I think you'll find fascinating.
Our product team has been obsessing over a breakthrough in our Tree Dasher 2.0 design – we've engineered a new responsive foam compound that delivers 15% better energy return while maintaining our signature sustainability standards. The updated SwiftFoam™ midsole now incorporates recycled materials without compromising the premium performance experience that discerning customers like you expect. We've also refined the eucalyptus tree fiber upper with enhanced breathability zones mapped to foot heat patterns – the kind of thoughtful design details that make a real difference in daily comfort.
I noticed you're getting early access to our summer collection (currently live but not widely advertised yet). This timing is perfect because we've just released limited colorways in both our performance and lifestyle lines, including some exclusive shades that won't be available to general customers until fall. The collection features our latest material innovations, including our new TrinoXO™ laces made from recycled ocean plastic – premium functionality meets environmental impact.
Since you've invested significantly in our mission over the years, I wanted to make sure you saw these innovations first. Your previous purchases have helped us offset over 200kg of carbon emissions, and these new releases push our sustainability technology even further forward.
Would you like me to send over the detailed performance specs for the Tree Dasher 2.0? I'd be happy to connect you with our product development team if you're interested in the technical innovations behind these updates.
Best regards,
Emma Chen
