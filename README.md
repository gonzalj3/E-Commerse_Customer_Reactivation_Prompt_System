## Problem Statement
E-commerce brands lose 75% of customers after their first purchase, with the highest churn occurring in months 2-4. Marketing firms of the future have clients that need AI-powered conversations that feel personal and strategic - knowing when to offer discounts vs. when to lead with product benefits to maximize both conversion and margins.

## Challenge
Create a prompt system that generates personalized reactivation messages while:
- Maintaining consistent brand voice across thousands of variations
- Making intelligent business decisions about discount offers
- Handling different customer personas and purchase histories
- Scaling from generic "batch and blast" to true 1-to-1 conversations

## Success Metrics
- Brand voice consistency scores
- Business logic accuracy rates  
- User preference testing results
- Multi-scenario adaptability
